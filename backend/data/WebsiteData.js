I worked with asynchronous requests, set up the Template Engine using Handlebars, implement the ability to support multiple pages, and render data.</p> <p>● Working with the database - I used the MongoDB database through the MongoDB Atlas service. I connected and configured the database using the Mongoose NPM package. Also created a user model.</p> <p>● Sessions and authorization - I added a registration and login page for subsequent authorization of users. Also added and saved sessions.</p> <p>● Worked with Email - the user can recover his password through the form. Next, the application will send Email to the person and, having a special token, the person will be able to change the password.</p> <p>● Profile page - worked with files: a profile page for each user has been implemented, where a person can change his profile picture.</p>"
